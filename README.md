# Hi! I'm Caleb. It's nice to meet you.
## About Me
I'm a front-end developer who is passionate about creating beautiful and functional web applications. My expertise lies in React, HTML, CSS and Ruby on Rails.

I have a strong understanding of front-end development principles and have gained experience building responsive and user-friendly web pages. I love using React to create dynamic user interfaces and manage state, and I have a knack for combining HTML and CSS to create visually appealing layouts. Plus, I have the added bonus of experience in integrating front-end components with Ruby on Rails back-end systems.

I've worked on a variety of projects in the past, both small and large-scale. From start to finish, I bring my skills in using version control systems (such as Git) and my focus on writing clean, maintainable and well-documented code to every project.

I'm a lifelong learner and love to stay up to date with the latest industry trends and best practices. Collaboration is key for me, and I enjoy working with others to find creative solutions to technical challenges.

If you're looking for a front-end developer who brings passion, experience, and a love for React, HTML, CSS and Ruby on Rails to the table, then I'm your guy! Let's work together and build something amazing!
